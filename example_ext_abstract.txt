Extended Abstract: Distributed Task Allocation for Multi-agent Urban Air Mobility

On 3/24/23, Jim Ecker, representing the Langley/Ames DRF Reasoning Team, delivered a comprehensive overview of Distributed Task Allocation for Multi-agent Urban Air Mobility. The essence of this discourse revolves around the adaptation and integration of artificial intelligence within the rapidly advancing domain of Urban Air Mobility (UAM).

Data & Reasoning Fabric (DRF)
The DRF is conceptualized as an evolved digital infrastructure that goes beyond traditional data services. In contemporary intelligent systems, seamless data access and advanced reasoning tools are paramount. DRF aims to provide just that, acting as an intricate tapestry of interconnected data sources and reasoning algorithms. Such a setup would greatly benefit aircraft systems, especially when navigating the complexities of urban landscapes. The envisioned "marketplace" is more than just a hub; it's a dynamically updating platform where service providers such as meteorological departments, geospatial agencies, and air traffic control can converge. This is reminiscent of the trend towards integrated digital ecosystems in other industries, drawing parallels with the Internet of Things (IoT) but tailored specifically for aviation.

Multi-agent Systems & CBBA
Multi-agent systems have been a subject of research interest for decades. They involve a collection of autonomous entities, or 'agents', which interact with each other to achieve collective goals. In the context of Urban Air Mobility, these agents could be drones or other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The CBBA algorithm is one such mechanism, tailored for efficient task allocation. By decentralizing control, it ensures that no single point of failure exists, a vital attribute in dynamic environments like urban airspace. Decentralized algorithms like CBBA often find applications in other areas, such as swarm robotics, where a collective of robots collaborates to perform tasks.

Practical Implications & Use Cases
Ecker's emphasis on the fire detection system post-lightning strikes underscores the real-world utility of multi-agent systems. Here, speed, efficiency, and accuracy are paramount. By employing a market-based auctioneering algorithm, tasks can be rapidly allocated based on the capability and availability of agents. This could be a game-changer for emergency responses in urban settings.

Agent Migration & Task Management
Agent migration, in computational terms, refers to the ability of an agent to move from one host or environment to another. In the UAM context, this could be seen as UAVs or drones reallocating themselves based on task priorities, resource availability, or other operational metrics. The repeated emphasis on this aspect suggests its crucial role in ensuring system robustness and adaptability.

Future Directions
The journey towards creating a truly integrated, intelligent multi-agent UAM system is ongoing. Eckerâ€™s mention of a modular library suggests an intention to create a scalable and customizable framework, allowing cities and service providers to adapt the system to their unique requirements. With the inclusion of Machine Learning (ML) for cost function discovery, the potential for the system to learn, adapt, and improve over time is evident. Another critical facet is the trustworthiness of distributed reasoning, which has parallels with the broader discussions on AI ethics and trust in automated systems.

In summary, Jim Ecker's presentation offers a deep dive into the potential future of urban air mobility, painting a picture of smart cities where a network of aerial agents operates seamlessly, driven by advanced algorithms and integrated data systems. The confluence of AI, multi-agent systems, and aviation could redefine urban transportation and emergency response in the years to come.
