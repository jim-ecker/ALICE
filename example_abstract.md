Jim Ecker, from the Langley/Ames DRF Reasoning Team, presented on the topic of Distributed Task Allocation for Multi-agent Urban Air Mobility on 3/24/23. The presentation outlined the vision and architecture of the Data & Reasoning Fabric (DRF) which aims to provide seamless access to data services and reasoning tools. It envisions creating an interconnected "fabric" of intelligence for aircrafts, integrating services such as weather information, mapping, and air traffic management. The multi-agent system would operate within smart city environments and leverage data from the DRF marketplace.

A significant part of the presentation was dedicated to explaining the Consensus Based Bundle Algorithm (CBBA) - a decentralized and cooperative algorithm tailored for efficient task allocation in multi-robot systems. The CBBA undergoes processes such as initialization, bidding, winner determination, consensus, and termination. Its advantages include scalability, adaptability, and robustness, but it faces challenges like ensuring agents share a common understanding and ensuring global optimality.

Practical use-cases of this system include fire detection after lightning strikes where the multi-agent system can auction the task of checking for fires in the affected area. Other aspects, like agent migration, were discussed in detail, with an emphasis on tasks, data management, and cost functions. A demo titled "Phoenix" demonstrated a UAV responding to node dropouts in a city network and replanning data migration.

Towards the end, Ecker discussed the next steps, emphasizing the creation of a modular library for multi-agent reasoning, exploring machine learning-based cost function discovery, and investigating data reasoning trust in distributed agent systems.
